I have loved you from the start
I have seen your hurting heart (your hurting heart)
And you feel so lonely, but you keep on hiding
'Cause you feel so guilty for what you've done, but

There's no distance too far, that I can't reach you
There's no place that's so dark, that I can't find you
Anywhere that you are, if you need proof
Take a look at these scars, and know I love you

Doesn't matter, doesn't matter, doesn't matter what you've done
You are never, you are never, never too far gone
Oh ah-oh, ah-oh
Oh ah-oh, ah-oh

You have run down every road
And you've lost your way back home (your way back home)
And you feel so dirty, you know you're unworthy
Feeling undeserving of any love, but

There's no distance too far, that I can't reach you
There's no place that's so dark, that I can't find you
Anywhere that you are, if you need proof
Take a look at these scars, and know I love you

Doesn't matter, doesn't matter, doesn't matter what you've done
You are never, you are never, never too far gone
Oh ah-oh, ah-oh
Oh ah-oh, ah-oh

You will never outrun my love, my love, my love
You will never outrun my love, my love, my love
You will never outrun my love, my love, my love
You will never outrun my love (you will never outrun my love)

There's no distance too far, that I can't reach you
There's no place that's so dark, that I can't find you
Anywhere that you are, if you need proof
Take a look at these scars, and know I love you

Doesn't matter, doesn't matter, doesn't matter what you've done
You are never, you are never, never too far gone
Oh ah-oh, ah-oh
Never too far gone
Oh ah-oh, ah-oh
Never too far gone
Oh ah-oh, ah-oh
Oh ah-oh, ah-oh
