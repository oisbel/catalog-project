Weak and wounded sinner
Lost and left to die
Raise your head for love is passing by

Come to Jesus
Come to Jesus
Come to Jesus and live

Now your burden's lifted and carried far away
Precious blood has washed away the stain

So sing to Jesus
Sing to Jesus
Sing to Jesus and live

And like a newborn baby, don't be afraid to crawl
And remember when we walk, sometimes we fall

So fall on Jesus
Fall on Jesus
Fall on Jesus and live

Sometimes the wait is lonely
It's deep and filled with pain
So if your sky is dark and coursed with rain

And cry to Jesus
Cry to Jesus
Cry to Jesus and live

Oh, and when the love spills over and music fills the night
And when you can't contain your joy inside

And dance for Jesus
Dance for Jesus
Dance for Jesus and live

With your final heartbeat, kiss the world goodbye
And go in peace, and laugh on glory's side

And fly to Jesus
Fly to Jesus
Fly to Jesus and live

Fly to Jesus
Fly to Jesus
Fly to Jesus and live
