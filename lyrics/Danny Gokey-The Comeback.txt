After a season of night falls and push backs
After the heartache of wrong turns and sidetracks
Just when they think they've got you game set match
Here comes the comeback
Just cause you lay low got up slow unsteady
Don't mean you blacked out or bought out you're ready
Just when they think there's nothing left running on empty
Here comes the comeback

This is your time your moment
The fire the fight your golden
You've come so far keep going
Oh here comes the comeback

You feel the lightning the thunder you're soul shakes
Under the roar of the heaven the tide breaks
And from the ashes you will take your place
Here comes the comeback

This is your time your moment
The fire the fight you're golden
You've come so far keep going
Oh here comes the comeback

There is no mountain you can't face
There is no giant you can't take
All of your tears were not a waste
Your one step away
Just when they think they've got you game set match
Oh here comes the comeback

This is your time your moment
The fire the fight or golden
You've come so far keep going
Oh here comes the comeback

(Oh oh oh oh)

Your comeback
Your comeback

(Oh oh oh oh)

Oh oh

(Oh oh oh oh)

Your comeback
Oh oh oh
Here comes the comeback

(Oh oh oh oh)
