Lights shine bright everywhere we go 
Music for the people to illuminate the soul 
Lights shine bright everywhere we go 
Music for the people, makin' music for the people 

I wanna magnify Your light 
I wanna reflect the sun 
Cut like precious diamonds 
With the colors by the millions 
This is the only world we know 
And for now this rental's our home 
If we gonna be a reflection 
Gotta make this third rock glow 
(Just so you know) 

Lights shine bright everywhere we go 
Music for the people to illuminate the soul 
Lights shine bright everywhere we go 
Music for the people, makin' music for the people 

Lights shine bright everywhere we go 
Music for the people to illuminate the soul 
Lights shine bright everywhere we go 
Music for the people 
Jesus music for the people 

Everywhere we go 
Lights shine bright, lights shine bright 
Everywhere we go 
Lights shine bright, lights shine bright

Lights in the city might be more than pretty, pretty 
That freaky shine might be more than meets the eye 
Anytime you see that sparkle in the dark you might look deeper, deeper 
It might be more than simply theatre 

Yo, that smile might be joy that's connected to the spirit 
The spirit might be contagious if you dare, you dare come near it 
I remember, can't forget, peace that you can't second guess 
Sparkle as the light reflects we writin' pay it forward checks 

Lights shine bright everywhere we go 
Music for the people to illuminate the soul 
Lights shine bright everywhere we go 
Music for the people, makin' music for the people 

Lights shine bright everywhere we go 
Music for the people to illuminate the soul 
Lights shine bright everywhere we go 
Music for the people 
Jesus music for the people 

Everywhere we go 
Lights shine bright, lights shine bright 
Everywhere we go 
Lights shine bright, lights shine bright

The lights in the city shine bright 
The lights in the city shine bright 
So let your heart light shine tonight

Lights shine bright everywhere we go 
Music for the people to illuminate the soul 
Lights shine bright everywhere we go 
Music for the people, makin' music for the people 

Lights shine bright everywhere we go 
Music for the people to illuminate the soul 
Lights shine bright everywhere we go 
Music for the people 
Jesus music for the people 

Everywhere we go 
Lights shine bright, lights shine bright 
Everywhere we go 
Lights shine bright, lights shine bright...
