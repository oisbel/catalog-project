We've prayed the prayer with no reply
Words float off into the night
Couldn't cut our doubt with the sharpest knife
Oh, oh God forgive us

Silence isn't comfortable
We want to drive through peace and instant hope
Our shallow faith it has left us broke

Oh, oh God forgive us
Oh, oh God forgive us
Enslaved to our uncertainty
Help us with our unbelief
Oh, oh God forgive us

Young and old, black and white
We're rich and poor, there's no divide
Hear the mighty, hear the powerless, singing

Oh, oh God forgive us
Oh, oh God forgive us
Enslaved to our uncertainty
Help us with our unbelief
Oh, oh God forgive us

With our white flag sailing in the night
Eyes pointed to the sky
Hands up and open wide, open wide

With our white flag sailing in the night
Eyes pointed to the sky
Hands up and open wide, open wide

With our white flag sailing in the night
Eyes pointed to the sky
Hands up and open wide, open wide

With our white flag sailing in the night
Eyes pointed to the sky
Hands up and open wide, open wide

Oh, oh God forgive us
Enslaved to our uncertainty
Help us with our unbelief
Oh, oh God forgive us
