C'mon
'bout to do it like this
'bout to do it like this
1-2-3-4

When I sit back and imagine
Life without you, I can't fathom
How I ever thought I'd make it on my own
And there's at least a million reasons
I'm still standing here believin'
You're my comfort, you're my healin'
This I know (this I know)

Well, you can't see the wind, but it moves the leaves
From the bottom to the top of the tallest trees
You are everything I will ever need
And they can't take that from me

Oh, I feel it in my heart
I feel it in my soul
That's how I know
You take our brokenness and make us beautiful
Yeah, that's how I know (can't take that from me)

Love came crashin' in
Never gonna be the same again
Yeah, You came crashing in
You wrecked me, You wrecked me
[x2]

Everybody talkin' like they need some proof
But what more do I need than to feel you
Everybody talkin' like they need some proof
But what more do I need than to feel you
