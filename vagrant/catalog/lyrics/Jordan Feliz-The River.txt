I know a place where we can go
To lay the troubles down eating your soul
I know a place where mercy flows
Take the stains make you whiter than snow

Like a tide, it is rising up deep inside a current that moves and makes you come alive
Living water that brings the dead to life

We're going down to the river
Down to the river, down to the river to pray
Let's get washed by the water
Washed by the water and rise up in amazing grace
Let's go down, down, down to the river (You will leave changed)
Let's go down, down, down to the river (Never the same)

I've seen it move in my own life
Took me from dusty roads into paradise
All of my dirt, all of my shame
Drowned in the streams that've made me born again

Like a tide, it is rising up deep inside a current that moves and makes you come alive
Living water that brings the dead to life

We're going down to the river
Down to the river, down to the river to pray
Let's get washed by the water
Washed by the water and rise up in amazing grace
Let's go down, down, down to the river (You will leave changed)
Let's go down, down, down to the river (Never the same)

Let's go down [x3]

We're going down to the river
Down to the river, down to the river to pray
Let's get washed by the water
Washed by the water and rise up in amazing grace
Let's go down, down, down to the river (You will leave changed)
Let's go down, down, down to the river (Never the same)

Gotta go, gotta go, gotta go down in amazing grace [x2]
