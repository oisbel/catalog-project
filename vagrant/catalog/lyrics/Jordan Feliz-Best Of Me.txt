I said goodbye to my chains
When I said hello to Your perfect love
I turned my head from my shame
When I looked upon the face of love

Givin' me a reason
Givin' life a meaning
Givin' out hope, that's what You do
All I ever needed
All I ever wanted
All that I seek is found in You

You got my heart flyin' up in the clouds
Lifting me up high above my doubts
Living in Your presence, now I can see
Only You bring out the best of me
The best of me
The best of
The best of me
The best of

You are the fire in my life
That makes me stronger than I am on my own
You are the peace that I find
The hand that holds and always leads me home

Givin' me a reason
Givin' life a meaning
Givin' out hope, that's what You do
All I ever needed
All I ever wanted
All that I seek is found in You

You got my heart flyin' up in the clouds
Lifting me up high above my doubts
Living in Your presence, now I can see
Only You bring out the best of me
The best of me
The best of
The best of me
The best of

Your Love inspires
Takes me higher
In You I find the best of me
You make me stronger
I'm a fighter
In You I find the best of me

You got my heart flyin' up in the clouds
Lifting me up high above my doubts
Living in Your presence, now I can see
Only You bring out the best of me
The best of me
The best of
The best of me
The best of

Your Love inspires
Takes me higher
In You I find the best of me
You make me stronger
I'm a fighter
In You I find the best of me
