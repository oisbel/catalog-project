I'm so confused
I know I heard You loud and clear
So, I followed through
Somehow I ended up here
I don-t wanna think
I may never understand
That my broken heart is a part of Your plan
When I try to pray
All I-ve got is hurt and these four words

Thy will be done
Thy will be done
Thy will be done

I know You-re good
But this don-t feel good right now
And I know You think
Of things I could never think about
It-s hard to count it all joy
Distracted by the noise
Just trying to make sense
Of all Your promises
Sometimes I gotta stop
Remember that You-re God
And I am not
So

Thy will be done
Thy will be done
Thy will be done
Like a child on my knees all that comes to me is
Thy will be done
Thy will be done
Thy will

I know You see me
I know You hear me, Lord
Your plans are for me
Goodness You have in store
I know You hear me
I know You see me, Lord
Your plans are for me
Goodness You have in store
So

Thy will be done
Thy will be done
Thy will be done
Like a child on my knees all that comes to me is
Thy will be done
Thy will be done
Thy will be done

I know You see me
I know You hear me, Lord
