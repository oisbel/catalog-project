Light of the world,
You stepped down into darkness.
Opened my eyes, let me see.
Beauty that made this heart,
Adore you.
Hope of a life spend with you.

So here I am to worship,
Here I am to bow down,
Here I am to say that you're my god.
You're altogether lovely,
All together worthy.
All together wonderful to me.

King of all day's oh so highly exalted.
Glorious in heaven above.
Humbly you came to the earth you created all for love's sake became poor.

Here I am to worship,
Here I am to bow down,
Here I am to say that You're my God
You're altogether lovely
All together worthy,
All together wonderful to me

I'll never know how much it cost
To see my sin upon that cross
I'll never know how much it cost
To see my sin upon that cross
I'll never know how much it cost
To see my sin upon that cross
I'll never know how much it cost

Here I am to worship,
Here I am to bow down,
Here I am to say that You're my God
You're altogether lovely
All together worthy,
All together wonderful to me

Here I am to worship,
Here I am to bow down,
Here I am to say that You're my God
You're altogether lovely
All together worthy,
All together wonderful to me

I'll never know how much it cost
To see my sins upon that cross
