When confusion's my companion
And despair holds me for ransom
I will feel no fear
I know that You are near

When I'm caught deep in the valley
With chaos for my company
I'll find my comfort here
'Cause I know that You are near

[Chorus:]
My help comes from You
You're right here, pulling me through
You carry my weakness, my sickness, my brokenness all on Your shoulders
Your shoulders
My help comes from You
You are my rest, my rescue
I don't have to see to believe that You're lifting me up on Your shoulders
Your shoulders

You mend what once was shattered
And You turn my tears to laughter
Your forgiveness is my fortress
Oh Your mercy is relentless

[Chorus:]
My help comes from You
You're right here, pulling me through
You carry my weakness, my sickness, my brokenness all on Your shoulders
Your shoulders
My help comes from You
You are my rest, my rescue
I don't have to see to believe that You're lifting me up on Your shoulders
Your shoulders

My help is from You
Don't have to see it to believe it
My help is from you
Don't have to see it, 'cause I know, 'cause I know it's true

My help is from You
Don't have to see it to believe it
My help is from you
Don't have to see it, 'cause I know, 'cause I know it's true

[Chorus:]
My help comes from You
You're right here, pulling me through
You carry my weakness, my sickness, my brokenness all on Your shoulders
Your shoulders
My help comes from You
You are my rest, my rescue
I don't have to see to believe that You're lifting me up on Your shoulders
Your shoulders

My help is from You
Don't have to see it to believe it
My help is from you
Don't have to see it, 'cause I know, 'cause I know it's true

[x3:]
My help is from You
Trying to see it to believe it
My help is from you
Trying to see it, 'cause I know, 'cause I know it's true
